# Taekwondo Club Website

This site was created at the request of the head instructor at a Taekwondo club operating in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Much of the written content, as well as some of the layout/design choices, were at the request of the instructor. Bootstrap is used for optimal appearance on mobile devices. The site contains information relating to the training schedule, contact information, the location of the club (using Google Maps), and links to various affiliated ITF Taekwondo organization websites.
